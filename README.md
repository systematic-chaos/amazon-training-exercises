**`longest_palindromic_substring.py`:**
An $O(n^{2})$ time and $O(1)$ space program to find the _longest palindromic substring_.

**`generalized_greatest_common_divisor.py`:**
Algorithm to determine the GCD of N positive integers.
The _greatest common divisor_ (GCD), also called highest common factor (HCF) of N numbers is
the largest positive integer that divides all numbers without giving a remainder.

**`positive_subsequence_sum.py`:**
Given a list of numbers, compute the _sum of the maximum positive sequence_, this is, the sum
of the sequence of consecutive non-negative numbers whose addition reaches a maximum value.
Also, given a list of numbers, compute the _sum of the longest positive sequence_, this is, the sum
of the longest sequence (in terms of number of elements) of consecutive non-negative numbers.
